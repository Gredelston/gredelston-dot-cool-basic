_Context: As part of my Zen practice, I periodically have one-on-one discussions with my teacher. These discusisons are called "dokusan." I'm playing with jotting down notes of those discussions. Maybe someday soon I'll write an introductory post on the topic, with more context about what dokusan is. But not today._

Today's was a short dokusan: we only had about 7 minutes.

- I had just returned from a week and a half of visiting friends and family in Boston and Connecticut. It was wonderful. I got to see so many people who are very important to me, some of whom I had not seen in many years.
- I had noticed strong judgmental tendencies in me, especially when dealing with the people and places I used to live closely with, and often hypocritically. I see this as in conflict with the precept of Not Elevating Self and Blaming Others.
  - Me: "Other than reminding myself of the precept and continuing to investigate the feeling, I'm not sure how to practically work with this." Sensei: "That is exactly how you work with it." üëç
- My zazen practice today was easy, concentrated, and wonderful. I was able to clearly narrow my focus into my practice (breathing, and counting the breaths) and avoid what was not my practice (the thoughts). I theorized that this is because I was experiencing the supportive environment of the zendo for the first time after a couple weeks away. I expressed a hope that I can hold onto this ease of concentration.
  - Sensei: "Yes, it helps our concentration when we're all together. And you are contributing to that concentration." Me: "Score."
- Minutia: I expressed concern about overhearing the previous dokusan while I'm waiting in the hallway. We agreed that as a remedy, I'll wait outside the front door.
